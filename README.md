  - `product_id`, `product_category`, `product_type`, `unit_price`, `transaction_qty`
  - `store_id`, `store_location`
  - Pre-calculated KPIs like `Sales`, `Orders`, `Quantity`, etc.

In addition to the Transactions table, a **custom Date Table** was created in Power BI using **DAX** to enable accurate and flexible time-based analysis. This Date Table includes fields like:
  - `Date`, `Month`, `Year`, `Weekday`, `Weekend`, `Week Number`, `Day Name`, etc.
